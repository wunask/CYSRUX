# CYSRUX

This Python script is a comprehensive network scanning and reporting tool that uses Nmap to discover live hosts, scan open ports, and detect vulnerabilities with associated CVEs. It extracts vulnerability data, generates detailed reports in JSON, Excel, and HTML formats, and includes QR code generation for easy report access. The tool leverages multithreading for efficient performance, fetches CVE details from the CIRCL API, and uses OpenAI's API to provide actionable mitigation steps for detected vulnerabilities.
